# ies_submodules
Version control with Git - final project

	• Application

	  > We have to discuss what kind of application we want to implement. I think that it will be nice to do it firstly using only locally defined submodule, as in this yt video:

	  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgIAXF53a8U&list=PL_RrEj88onS-jN7dZb-tYz0cpsxuA23Cm

	  and then move everything to GitHub. 

	  I think that it will be good to have overall 4 repositories?

	  - one independent with whole wiki about submodules
	  - three dependent ([1,2,3]), first uses second as a submodule and second uses third as a submodule, so we have nested submodule situation in this second repository

	• Theoretical framework
	• Examples
	• Tasks
	• Pros & cons
	• Github page???


Practical points:
Markdown /latex

More general notes???

- it seems that it is not possible to work on adding some submodule only in one branch. Having submodule on my branch **mv_dev** and switched into **main** branch, all the files in the directory **ies_subsubmodules** didn't disappear. Till the 305 page of the book there was anything about that but maybe later it is.
